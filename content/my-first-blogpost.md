Welcome to the first (and maybe last, for I am fickle and lazy) blog post for the PBRB website! It is with some trepidation that I begin writing this as I have a nasty feeling it means I'll be obliged to write more. However it seems like a useful way to communicate events and developments within the clan, not to mention also filling the bit on the website I foolishly titled "Blog".

I imagine this will be appearing on a site in a similar degree of [constrution as one of my minecraft projects](http://www.pbrb.co.uk/default.html) . With any luck however we should have something vaguely useful on here quickly given I am clearly not wasting any efforts on aesthetics (see bacon-based background), or even content particularly (see this blog post). 

##Preparing For i52

What better way to prepare for a weekend of sitting then with a weekend of sitting! Yes, PBRB is going to i52, but first we're holding our own i-1⁄52 at home. In my living room in fact. There we can enjoy all the highs and lows we are sure to experience at the big event, in miniature, including but not limited to...

* networking problems,
* cramped conditions,
* and maybe even fun!

The presiding oppinion appear to be that we should just play gmod minigames over and over and over until everyone has [eaten the requisite ammount of shit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikgWE7v1lI4). Although I'm sure we will also end up playing other, less dick rip inducing, games like **Team Fortress 2, DOTA 2, Space Engineers, Castle Crashers, Minecraft, Peggle, Candy© Crush® Saga™, Mouse Trap, ect...** And given the veritable cornucopia of spare hardware we all have there will be no shortage of equipment you to play with if you don't have your own to bring. And, unlike your mum, we won't even charge. (Thanks for the joke Mr Brooker) 

The date, which can be found on the events page, is the 9<sup>th</sup> to the 10<sup>th</sup> of August, but it is a weekend thing so you're welcome to turn up the night before to setup and crash if you want. Unless of course you're not a clan member, in which case I will be rather confused as to why you're stood at my door with a bunch of computer equipment...

##Glorious Webmaster Improves Lives in Peoples Republic of Clan

I terms of actually preparing to go to the LAN proper, I am hoping to orchestrate the next blog post as a checklist of stuff you will want to enjoy the LAN to the fullest, compile scientifically by asking people who've been before what they'll be bringing. Se this blog might actually serve a useful purpose!

So watch this space over the coming months, as the hope is I can make this the comprehensive source of clan information and clan user-made-content! If it doesn't beat me over the nose with a newspaper and ask why exactly I'm paying for this DNS!
